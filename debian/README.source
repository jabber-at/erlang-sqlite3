erlang-p1-sqlite3 for Debian
----------------------------

This package uses a DFSG clean tarball, the difference being that the
upstream tarball includes source code from sqlite3 that isn't needed here
and has been removed. The libsqlite3-dev package is used instead.

The removed files are:
 sqlite3_amalgamation/shell.c
 sqlite3_amalgamation/sqlite3.h
 sqlite3_amalgamation/sqlite3ext.h
 sqlite3_amalgamation/sqlite3.c
